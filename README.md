# Hey there! 👋 I'm Oscar Piedrasanta Diaz  

## 🚀 **Full Stack Developer | From Sales to Software**  

With a background in **sales leadership and high-performance team management**, I transitioned into **software engineering** because I saw the potiential the industry had when it came to increasing productivity. 

With all the amazing people I got to meet in my sales journey, I realized that Tech was and will always be part of our future. So I made the hard decision to start from scratch and start builiding. I always knew that if I could persevere as one of the worst sales rep that my company ever had with making one sale per week to going to 30 sales per week and becoming **the top performer** in the **country** on multiple occasions that I could learn the ropes in software enginnering. 

Now I build **scalable applications and cloud-based solutions**. I have **experience in microservices architecture, cloud deployments, and API development**, with expertise in **Spring Boot, React.js, Node.js, and Docker**.

💡 **Currently:**  
🎓 Wrapping up my **Computer Programming & Analysis** Advance Diploma at George Brown College *(Graduating April 2025!)*  
💼 Working as a **Full Stack Developer** on contract projects  
🛠️ Building cool projects in **Spring Boot, React.js, Node.js, Swift and Python**
